Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    - When the configuration is seted up:
        - Problem happens will take 1 minute
        - Raise alerts will take 5 minutes
        - Automatically switch to the second availability zone will tack 1 minute
    Total will take under 10 minutes

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    - If there is a complete region outage, where all AZs in a region become unavailable, the RTO is typically higher compared to a single AZ outage
        - Problem happens will take 1 minute
        - Time passes before an alert triggers will take 5 minutes
        - Alert triggers on-all staff will take 1 minute
        - On-call staff detect  will take 20 minutes
        - Root cause is discovered will take 10 minutes
        - Remediation started will take 10 minutes
        - Issue fixed will take 5 minutes
    Total will take under 55 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    - It take 5 minutes to fail, then the data will be lost

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    - In the case of a complete region outage, the RPO can be slightly higher compared to a single AZ outage. Minimun RPO will be 4 hours
